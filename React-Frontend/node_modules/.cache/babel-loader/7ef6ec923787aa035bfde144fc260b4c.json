During the game, play typically involves exchanging pieces for the opponent's similar pieces, and finding and engineering opportunities to trade advantageously or to get a better position. In addition to checkmate, a player wins the game if the opponent resigns, or, in a timed game, runs out of time. There are also several ways that a game can end in a draw.</p></div>\r\n                  <div className=\"card-mid\" />\r\n                  <div className=\"card-bottom\"><a href=\"services.html\" className=\"borders-btn\">Get Started</a></div>\r\n                </div>\r\n              </div>\r\n            </section>\r\n            <style dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{__html: \"  h1 { \\n            color: green; \\n        } \\n        img { \\n            float: left; \\n            margin-right: 75px; \\n        } \\n        p { \\n            text-align: justify; \\n            font-size: 18px; \\n        } \\n    \" }} /> \r\n         \r\n          {/* Pricing Card End */}\r\n          {/* Scroll Up */}\r\n          <div id=\"back-top\">\r\n            <a title=\"Go to Top\" href=\"#\"> <i className=\"fas fa-level-up-alt\" /></a>\r\n          </div>\r\n          {/* JS here */}\r\n          {/* Jquery, Popper, Bootstrap */}\r\n          {/* Jquery Mobile Menu */}\r\n          {/* Jquery Slick , Owl-Carousel Plugins */}\r\n          {/* One Page, Animated-HeadLin */}\r\n          {/* Date Picker */}\r\n          {/* Nice-select, sticky */}\r\n          {/* Progress */}\r\n          {/* counter , waypoint,Hover Direction */}\r\n          {/* contact js */}\r\n          {/* Jquery Plugins, main Jquery */}\t\r\n        </main></div>\r\n      );\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default sport3;"]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
