[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Karaychentsev/calendarjs.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Karaychentsev/calendarjs)

A simple javascript component to help you create weeks in a month
that is properly displayable.

You will get something like this:
```
[ [ { month: 5, date: 1, day: 0, year: 2017, dayOfYear: 121 },
    { month: 5, date: 2, day: 1, year: 2017, dayOfYear: 122 },
    { month: 5, date: 3, day: 2, year: 2017, dayOfYear: 123 },
    { month: 5, date: 4, day: 3, year: 2017, dayOfYear: 124 },
    { month: 5, date: 5, day: 4, year: 2017, dayOfYear: 125 },
    { month: 5, date: 6, day: 5, year: 2017, dayOfYear: 126 },
    { month: 5, date: 7, day: 6, year: 2017, dayOfYear: 127 } ],
  [ { month: 5, date: 8, day: 0, year: 2017, dayOfYear: 128 },
    { month: 5, date: 9, day: 1, year: 2017, dayOfYear: 129 },
    { month: 5, date: 10, day: 2, year: 2017, dayOfYear: 130 },
